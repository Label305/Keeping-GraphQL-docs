# introduction

The Keeping API gives you access to a large amount of data that enables you to integrate Keeping into your applications. The API is based on GraphQL which provides great benefits when it comes to performance, maintainability and ease of use.

Use cases for this API may include: tracking the working hours of your employees using the report object, automating the creation of new clients and projects or the adding of new teammembers using mutations or giving an overview of detailed information on all projects currently being worked on within your company.
